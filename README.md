In a Node.js project, scripts like `lint`, `start`, `dev`, and `debug` are often defined in the `package.json` file under the `"scripts"` field. These scripts are usually used to perform common tasks like linting code, starting the application, running it in development mode, or debugging it. Here's how we can run each of them:

1. **Lint**: Linting is the process of checking our code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, or suspicious constructs. It helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

To run the lint script, we typically use a linter like ESLint or JSHint. First, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. Then, we can run the lint script using npm or yarn. Here's an example:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

2. **Start**: The start script is used to start Node.js application. This script is often used in production environments to launch the application.

To run the start script, we simply execute:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

3. **Dev**: The dev script is commonly used during development. It usually starts the application in a development mode, which might include features like automatic reloading when files change.

To run the dev script:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. **Debug**: The debug script is used to start the application in debug mode, which allows us to attach a debugger and inspect the running code.

To run the debug script:

```bash
npm run debug
# or
yarn debug
```

Note: The behavior of these scripts depends on how they are defined in our `package.json` file. We can customize the scripts to suit the needs of our project.
